Cloud Technology Skills: Saj has identified the need to enhance his Azure cloud skills at both the architect and DBA levels. This is a critical area for development, given the increasing reliance on cloud infrastructure. He should prioritize training, hands-on projects, and collaboration with cloud experts to build his proficiency.
