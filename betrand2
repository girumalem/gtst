Bertrand has proactively maintained database health through regular maintenance, including implementing solutions for idle connection cleanup and connection pooling. He consistently ensured business continuity by providing reliable on-call support and effectively responding to urgent issues.  Furthermore, he strengthened our data protection by implementing robust backup and recovery processes for PIC and ODX.  Bertrand also played a crucial role in the ODX database consolidation, resulting in improved efficiency and cost savings, and led the Secure for PIC project, automating database access requests and streamlining processes.  These accomplishments highlight his technical skills, leadership, and commitment to the team's success.  He faced several challenges this year, including the demanding workload of the ODX database consolidation and the collaborative efforts required for the Secure for PIC project.  Managing regular maintenance, upgrades, migrations, and support tasks allowed him to further enhance his technical skills and adaptability.  His on-call experiences, especially during busy patching weeks, have strengthened his multitasking and prioritization abilities.  We are thankful for his support and help throughout the year and recognize that these experiences have provided a great learning block for the future.
